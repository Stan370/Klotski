Klotski is a sliding block puzzle that's popular throughout China. Its story is based on a well known encounter during the Eastern Han dynasty (25–220) between Cao Cao, the shrewd and clever strategist for the Wei Kingdom, and Guan Yu, a commander in the Shu Kingdom army who had once served under Cao Cao. The goal is to move the largest block (2X2 block) to an exit with a two grid side length below without taking it away from the board, while only sliding the blocks

The game is named after the story of Cao Cao's defeat on the Huarong Road in "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" and Guan Yunchang's righteous explanation of Cao Cao. But the origin of this game is not what most people consider to be 'one of the oldest games in China'. The history of the Huarongdao game should be very short. John Harold Fleming obtained patent for a puzzle in 1934 in England.In 1943, the Huarong Dao was publicized by Liang Qing, a teacher in the New Fourth Route Army who learnt it from people living in northern Jiangsu province, among soldiers to enhance their cultural life.

In France, a similar game is called 'Red Donkey'.
In Japan, similar games are known as "箱入り娘", and there is also a version based on Japanese chess (shogi).
