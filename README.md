# Klotski: The Sliding Block Puzzle  


Klotski is a WEB sliding block puzzle that's popular throughout China. Its story is based on a well-known encounter during the **Eastern Han dynasty (25â€“220)** between **Cao Cao**, the shrewd and clever strategist for the Wei Kingdom, and **Guan Yu**, a commander in the Shu Kingdom army who had once served under Cao Cao.  

### **Gameplay**  
The goal is to move the largest block (2x2 block) to an exit with a two-grid side length below without taking it away from the board, while only sliding the blocks.

This project is a browser-based Klotski puzzle game, inspired by the classic Klotski by ZH Computer (1991, Windows 3.0). It features level-based leaderboards using Redis, tracks user moves, and allows players to compete for the lowest move count. The game is built with TypeScript, Redis, and a frontend UI, and was integrated into Reddit as a game post to attract players.

### **Historical Background**  
The game is named after the story of **Cao Cao's defeat on the Huarong Road** in *"Romance of the Three Kingdoms"* and **Guan Yunchang's righteous explanation of Cao Cao's release**.
